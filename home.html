        <h3>Blog:</h3>
        <p>So sometimes I do this thing where I just completely ramble about absolutely nothing and everything at the same time.
            Isn't it crazy that someone can have so much to say even though absolutely no one is listening? Haha, that's totally me.
            Anyway, thanks for checking out my blog, I hope you had a wonderful time reading whatever the heck this is.

        <h3>Developing:</h3>
        <p>Okay so I'm basically a professional developer at this point. I have done C# and now HTML/CSS. So all of you should just bow down to me. Hehe peasants.</p>

        <h3>Hometown</h3>
        <p>I am from Genovia. I was supposed to be the queen there but I have decided to give up the throne and live the civilian life. It's definitely not worth it.
            For sure am regretting my decision and I don't like it at all.
